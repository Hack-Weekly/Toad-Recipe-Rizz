# create-svelte

Everything you need to build a Svelte project, powered by [`create-svelte`](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/tree/master/packages/create-svelte).

## Creating a project

If you're seeing this, you've probably already done this step. Congrats!
## Developing

Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with `yarn`, start a development server:

```bash
# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
yarn run dev
```

## Building

To create a production version of your app:

```bash
yarn run build
```

You can preview the production build with `yarn run preview`.

> To deploy your app, you may need to install an [adapter](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/adapters) for your target environment.
